# LLMBasics

This repository contains sample code for LLM Basics knowledge sharing session.

The .NET examples need OpenAI API key to work. Set it up in your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and top-up your account with a few USD. Then set up the key in `appsettings.development.json`:

```json
  "Settings": {
    "OpenAiApiKey": "open_ai_key"
  },
```
